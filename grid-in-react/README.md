# How to create a dynamic matrix in React
This project explains how you can create a dynamic matrix in react using the concept of reusability and modularity. Creating a dynamically sized array and then styling it accordingly to form a grid is the key to complete this task.
This project takes the styling of blocks to another level to form a classic check board pattern.

# Getting Started with  Create React App

You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
